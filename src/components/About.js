            Hi, Iâ€™m Laislla, I am a Software developer with six years of
            experience developing web applications. My main programming language
            is C#, but I also have hands-on experience with PHP, which is my
            first programming language. <br></br> <br></br>
            I'm a restless learner and committed to achieving goals.
            Certifications are my tools to spread good practices and high
            standards on my team.
